# ExcelNetworkCalculator
Do cool things with IP addresses in this Excel sheet. No macros! !!

Features: 
CALCULATE NETWORK - Given an IP address and CIDR, calculate its individual network
SUBNETTING - See relation between the number of Hosts and Networks based on CIDR.
FORMAT - Format an IP address so it has 3 digites in each octect.
RESERVED IP ADDRESSES AND CLASSES - The amount of reserved space is a little more complicated than what I knew about.
